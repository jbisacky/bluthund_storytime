Last Saturday, I walked my Hund along the Hauptstrasse.
I saw the Flughafen in the distance.
I felt angry because all the new flights over Munich have made it so noisy.
One time, I was so startled by the noise, I fell down the Ratskeller with my fresh Brot.
After I recovered from my fall, I heard some musik coming from a nearby Biergarten.
I walked towards the Biergarten and to my delight they had a baeckerei!
The cool air from the store's klimaanlage felt so nice when I stepped in.
This same air carried a sweet aroma of fresh gebaecks. 
Then my hund ate all the fresh gebaecks, and thats the story of why I'm no longer welcome at the biergarten.
Sometimes when I get a craving for more gebaeck, I throw on my dirndel of disguise to blend in, leave the hund at home, and they never notice it's me!
Now I drive a BMW to deliver gebaecks for DoorDash.
The upside is now I get to take the hauptstrasse to Raesfeld and their baeckerei is wunderbar!
Apparently, their Konditor is know for being quite wettbewerbsfaehig in preparing the best gebaeck in Germany.
Not only is he known for his gebaeck but he is also a Gauss, this person can do everything!
